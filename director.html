							<p>Before making this movie, Bong Joon-ho was already a famous name in the movie industry. In the 2013 movie Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho has already expressed his 
                                concerns about life in a capitalistic society. The main theme of the movie emphasizes how capitalistic domination in the world is conected to most of the problems people have to put up with in everyday life. 
                                Snowpiercer received great success and it was followed up with another hit, Okja (2017). Okja is yet another socially and politically oriented film, with its focus on 
                                inhumane treatment of animals for the sake of profit of capitalistic societies. Another connection with inequality in society can be made with one of Bong's early works, The Host(2006).
                                In this work, Bong expressed his concerns about power in society through a story of scientists who disregarded nature and people's lives, which lead to an emergence of an atomic lizard. 
                            </p>
                            <p>As previously mentioned, Parasite was the winner of multiple prestigious awards and so was Bong Joon-ho. Apart from the movie Parasite, which won him Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, films like Okja and Snowpiercer also contributed in Bong being put in the Metacritic's list of the 25 best film director of the 21st century.</p>
