							<p>The idea for the movie Parasite originated back in 2013, when the director Bong Joon-ho was encouraged to write a play.
                            His ideas were influenced by his personal experiences and by other different sources like the Korean movie The Housemaids where a wealthy family is disrupted by a 'household helper'.
                            Bong's personal experiences projected itself in the movie, as Bong was a tutor himself when he was younger. Moreover, Moon-Gwang's allergy to peaches was inspired by one of Bong's firends having this allergy.
                        </p>
                        <p>The movie's name was picked by Bong to serve as a double meaning, but it was hard to convince the marketing group to name it that way. Bong said "Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, 
                            it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites."</p>
                            <p>Parasite won many awards worldwide, but the most notable ones are the 2020 Academy Awards where they were awarded an Oscar for four categories: Best Motion Picture of the Year (first foreign language film to win it), Best Achievement in Directing (Bong Joon-ho), Best Original Screenplay (Bong Joon-ho, Han Jin-won), Best International Feature Film. </p>
